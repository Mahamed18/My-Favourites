      I've been watching animes since I was a little kid and I'm quite fond of
      them. In my opinion there are simply more things you can do with the
      animation medium than live action. I've watched quite a lot of anime but
      here are a few of my favourites:

      I wasn't always a fan of first person shooter games, but earlier last year
      I was introduced to valorant and have been a fan ever since. It has lots
      of unique character abilities and actually has a lot of strategy behind it
      making it more difficult than you would think.

    <p>
      I've always been really into geography, but one day I stumbled across a
      unique type of comics called Countryballs. They are comics where each
      country is you guessed it in ball form. The comics are typically filled to
      the brim with references to things in geopolitics both currently and in
      history. There are a lot of channels who use these as visuals while
      disussing politics and history. Here are my favourites:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Kraut_the_Parrot" target="_blank"
          >Kraut
        </a>
        - I recommend this channel the most as everything discussed is very well
        made and in depth. Most of his content speaks about how countries ended
        up in the situation their in now. My personal favourite series from him
        is where he compares Mexico and the US and why the US is far richer.
        Despite him being very well versed in english literature he is from
        Vienna, Austria.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@h0ser/featured" target="_blank"
          >Hoser
        </a>
        - He has actually strayed away from the Countryball format I'm not
        entirely sure why but his content is mainly focused on current events
        around the world and his predictions. Plus he is a fellow Canadian so
        that's cool!
      </li>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Icariaball" target="_blank"
          >Icariaball
        </a>
        - This channel is actually mainly comedic and pokes fun at current and
        past events around the world. His "Meet the ____" series is my personal
        favourite as it has the most references and I find it fun to be able to
        point out the little details and understand them. (Also, he is from
        Greece and his video thumbnail is the image used above).
